# shell
by Steve Wang and Yifan Wang

# Features:
  Forks and executes commands
  Parses multiple commands on one line
  
# Attempted
  exit() runs, but does not exit out of the shell
  Tried to implement redirection and piping, but doesn't work ("No such file or 
  directory").
  
# Bugs
  Putting two ;'s next to each other runs the commands on both sides, but also tries   running the ; and thus prints "Could not execute."
  Putting more than 1 space between the command and its arguments does not run the 
  command.
